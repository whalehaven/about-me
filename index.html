    <p>Welcome to my page! Thanks for visiting. As I embark on my journey towards a professional level of web development, I must remember to appriciate my humble beginings. This page will reflect simple interests and pontifications about the world and the forces that act upon it. There won't be anything novel to find here, however; if you are in search of a description of a human, or even an idea to spark a conversation, I hope you will find just that. A human who wants to encourage conversation. Most of the topics that will be discussed (and very well may change as time goes on) will reside within the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Baking</li>
      <li>Alternative Music</li>
      <li>Corperate America</li>
      <li>Interpersonal Relationships</li>
      <li>And of course, software development!</li>
      <li>Other topics of which I am not clever enough to mention yet</li>
    </ul>
